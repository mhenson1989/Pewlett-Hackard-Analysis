# **Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis**
## **Overview**
The purpose of this analysis was to create a comprehensive view of the employees at Pewlett Hackard and to create a subsequent database for this employee data to live. Additionally, this analysis was used to provide management an understanding and look at the number of current employees who were eligible for retirement in the near future, in order to create a strategic plan for a mass exodus of staff. 

## **Results**
1. Pewlett Hackard should be prepared for a significant number of open positions within the next few years due to eligible retirees. 
- As seen in the chart below, Pewlett Hackard has a large number of staff positions eligible to retire, especially in senior positions and engineering positions. This will has the potential to pose severe impact to operations, the positions are clustered in specific departments. It is recommended that Pewlett Hackard make efforts to fill these positions proactively at lower levels, in order to position others for proper advancement into senior positions.

2. There are 133,777 employees listed in the retirement_titles table vs. 72,459 employees listed in the unique_titles, which indicates that Pewlett Hackard is a company that promotes from within. 
- Looking at a snapshot of the retirement_titles csv, you can see several employees who were promoted from a staff position to a senior position.

3. Based on Pewlett Hackard's proclivity for promoting from within, there are likely several positions within the organization that will be eligible to fill the significant number of Senior positions that are set to retire. With this in mind, a mentorship program is the right path forward, particuarly when approaching the Engineering department, who is set to have a significant impact from this "silver tsunami".

4. When considering the initial criteria pulled for the potential mentorship program, there is significantly less candidates (approx. 1500) than employees who are set to retire. I would recommend expanding the criteria for this mentorship program, or creating a second tier of eligible candidates that are groomed within a "promotion pipeline". With a mass exodus of staff, this will inevitably effect staff morale, due to increase workload and major changes within the organization. Therefore creating a pathway for existing employees (even those who are not defined within the mentorship program), will increase the liklihood of retention in staff who is not likely to retiire in the near future. 

## **Summary**

*How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?*
Pewlett-Hackard should expect 72,458 roles to be impacted (based on the querie pulled) within this "silver tsunami". The majority of the roles are within senior, lead and manager positions. Though the impact will not be seen instantaneously, the numbers are significant and should be acknowledged. Based on the company's history, it is likely that the majority of the positions will be filled internally, and what Pewlett-Hackard will likely be hiring is entry level positions to back-fill positions which were promoted. 

*Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?*
I believe that there are an adequate number of retirement-ready employees to create a mentorship program, and in fact, I would recommend expanding the criteria of the mentorship program, since there are quite a few less mentees than retirees.
